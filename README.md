# SWMichigan-Breweries
Simple website utilizing flexbox to show pictures of breweries in Berrien County, Michigan. Currently the user can click on one of the images to go the breweries main website. Images themselves hover.


Only one web page. Has an HTML file and CSS file. Imported one image locally, the others were found online.


This website is for beer fans and tourists. Also for me since I like the local breweries. Made this to work on my personal skills on HTML and CSS.


TO DO:


Add more breweries.


Add hover text to each image.


Brainstorm more ideas for this website...
